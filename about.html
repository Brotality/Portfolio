<h2 style="margin-top: 0.5em">About Me</h2>
<p>Recently I completed a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Software Development with a minor in IT in New Media at the Australian National University.</p>
<p>I am a passionate programmer and have participated in many group projects as well as completed many personal projects since 2011. I take pride in creating clean, elegant and efficient code. I am keen to learn any new language, or software, and further hone my programming skills. I enjoy working in a team environment and I am equally comfortable undertaking activities individually when required. I aspire to create new technologies which improve our quality of life. In my spare time, my hobby is to create Unity3D games and I would like to publish my own games as an independent developer within the next few years.</p>
