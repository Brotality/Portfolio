<div id="General Info" class="tab-body">
    <p>Made in my spare time while on university breaks. The idea of this game was to create a simple fun multiplayer game for my friends that simulated playing paintball &amp; laser tag. This game is nowhere near complete and has a lot of bugs, but since I've coded everything except the UFPS controller I'm relatively happy with what I've made so far. Also this was my first attempt at a networked game and was made before I did a networking course.</p>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <p>Standard FPS. W A S D move, Shift sprint, Space jump, LMB shoot, RMB zoom, Tab scoreboard.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Simple multiplayer FPS shooter with multiple game modes:
    <ul>
        <li>FFA - Free For All</li>
        <li>TDM - Team Death Match</li>
        <li>CTF - Capture The Flag</li>
        <li>LTS - Last Team Standing (similar to counter strike)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>I recommend changing the level in the 'Game Settings' to 'level2' as its a better test map with the vibe I was aiming for.</p>
